✦ A python script using shutil, re for modular expressions and tkinter for a simple user-friendly UI!

# Usage

✦ Download the file, and run it. 

✦ Use the in-house directory browser and select the directory containing all the folders you wish to rename with a 'num_' format (**NOTE: This script only applies to FOLDERS for now**):

# Normal Usage
✦ Then, there are a few things you can do:
✦ If you just want to rename all the folders in the directory from 1 - n in the order they are already in, just press **process folders**:

✦ It will automatically apply the prefix to all the folders in the directory, and the dialogue box will automatically update to show you the progress.

# Putting folders last
✦ You can also choose the folders to put at the end, which allows you to do your own ordering.

✦ Clicking the **select folders** button opens the explorer and will allow you to select one file which will be put last, and then you can click it again and again an indefinite amount of times, and each one you add will be added after the last. 
✦ i.e in the image, I selected **01_1-Normal** first then **02_2-Cape** and finally **03_3-Horns** last, so they will be placed in the order of 01_1-Normal, 02_2-Cape, 03_3-Horns.

# Removing Prefixes
✦ Additionally, you can click the checkbox, and then press process folders, which will remove any prefixes placed by **THIS** script only, meaning only prefixes in the 'num_' style.

# Removing and resorting folders
✦ Finally, pressing the remove folders button will open the explorer and allow you to remove a folder from the directory, and it will automatically adjust the current order for you.
